# Pokénator
Inspired by Akinator, Pokénator is a pokemon guessing game that tries to guess what the user is thinking of in a limited period of time.

## Core Components
- Learns from user feedback and improves guessing algorithm with weights

## Development Plan
- The guessing system will initially focus on concrete characteristics (types, colors, shapes, evolution stages) from the first generation.
    - Create extractor from PokeAPI that takes characteristics and data from pokemon
- Create template React website
- Link endpoints with Azure
- Weights will be added later for more accurate guessing
- Expand to subjective user characteristics (cool, cute, scary)
